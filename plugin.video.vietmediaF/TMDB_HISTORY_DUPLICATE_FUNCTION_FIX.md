# TMDB Search History Dialog Not Appearing - Duplicate Function Fix

## Problem Description

The TMDB search history dialog was not appearing on subsequent searches. Users reported that when they clicked on "TMDB Search" for the second time, they only saw a simple keyboard input instead of the history dialog with options to:
- Enter a new search term
- Select from previous searches
- Delete search history

## Root Cause Analysis

After debugging the issue, it was discovered that there were **two `show_search_form()` functions** defined in `resources/tmdb_search.py`:

1. **First function (line 1224)**: The correct implementation with full history functionality
2. **Second function (line 1666)**: A duplicate implementation without history functionality

In Python, when there are multiple functions with the same name, the **last defined function overrides all previous ones**. This meant that the second `show_search_form()` function was being called instead of the first one, which is why the history dialog was not appearing.

## The Fix

**Removed the duplicate function** at line 1666 that was overriding the correct implementation.

### Before (Problematic Code):
```python
def show_search_form():
    """
    Hiển thị form nhập từ khóa tìm kiếm với lịch sử
    """
    # ... correct implementation with history functionality ...

# ... other code ...

def show_search_form():  # DUPLICATE - This overrides the first one!
    """
    Hiển thị form tìm kiếm TMDB
    """
    # ... simple implementation without history ...
```

### After (Fixed Code):
```python
def show_search_form():
    """
    Hiển thị form nhập từ khóa tìm kiếm với lịch sử
    """
    # ... correct implementation with history functionality ...

# ... other code ...
# (duplicate function removed)
```

## Impact

- ✅ **Fixed**: TMDB search history dialog now appears correctly on subsequent searches
- ✅ **Maintained**: All existing functionality remains intact
- ✅ **Improved**: Users can now access their search history as intended

## Testing

After the fix, the TMDB search functionality should work as follows:

1. **First search**: Shows simple keyboard input (no history yet)
2. **Subsequent searches**: Shows dialog with options:
   - `[Nhập từ khóa mới]` - Enter new search term
   - `[Xóa lịch sử tìm kiếm]` - Delete search history
   - `[Previous search 1]` - Select from previous searches
   - `[Previous search 2]` - etc.

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. **Code Review**: Always check for duplicate function names during code review
2. **IDE Warnings**: Use an IDE that warns about duplicate function definitions
3. **Testing**: Test all functionality after making changes to ensure nothing is broken
4. **Documentation**: Keep track of function names and their purposes
